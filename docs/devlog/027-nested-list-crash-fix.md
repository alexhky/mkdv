# Fix: nested-list SIGABRT + scroll lag in show_scrollable

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Branch:** `fix/nested-list-crash`
**Date:** 2026-05-17

## Summary

v0.1.8 crashes (`SIGABRT`, `panicked at lib.rs:566: internal error: entered unreachable code`) when opening markdown files with nested lists and scrolling past them. Two coredumps from a T470 on 2026-05-16 confirmed the panic site is `List::start_item` finding an empty `items` stack.

This fix is three crash-fix changes (Fix B, Fix C, Fix A), one scroll-perf change (Fix P1a), and regression coverage.

## Root Cause (Three Independent Bugs, Same Symptom)

### Bug 1: `delayed_events_list_item` stopped at first `TagEnd::Item`

`crates/egui_commonmark/egui_commonmark_backend/src/pulldown.rs:52-74` collected events until the first `Event::End(TagEnd::Item)`. When a list item contained a nested sub-list, this was the inner item's close — not the outer item's close. The remainder of the outer item (further inner items, the inner `EndList`, and the outer `EndItem`) leaked back to the outer `show()` loop. The existing half-mitigation at lines 64-67 (early-exit on inner `Tag::List` start) didn't help — by the time it fired the renderer's `list.items` already had the inner level pushed and the leaked events still reached the outer loop.

### Bug 2: math-feature parser-options mismatch

`show()` parses events with `parser_options_math(options.math_fn.is_some() || cfg!(feature = "math"))` (parsers/pulldown.rs:461). `show_scrollable()` parses with `parser_options_math(options.math_fn.is_some())` (parsers/pulldown.rs:565). mkdv enables the `math` cargo feature, so the two parses produced *different* event streams for any document containing `$…$` patterns (currency, env-var interpolation, regex). Split-points were registered with indices into `cache.cached_events` (with-math) but consumed against `sc.events` (without-math) by the viewport-skip path. The two indices diverged on real docs; iteration jumped to an unrelated event — often `Tag::Item` with no matching `Tag::List` start — and panicked exactly the same way.

### Bug 3: `is_block_end_tag` allowed mid-container split-points

`crates/egui_commonmark/egui_commonmark/src/parsers/pulldown.rs:369-387` accepts `TagEnd::Item` and `TagEnd::List(_)` unconditionally as block-end split-point sites. With bug 1 fixed, the outer `show()` loop no longer *sees* mid-list events — but if anything similar regresses in the future, the viewport-skip math could still land iteration in a half-built renderer state. Container state is `pub(self)` on `CommonMarkViewerInternal`, so the bootstrap loop can gate split-points contextually after `process_event` runs.

## Fixes

### Fix B — Depth-track `delayed_events_list_item`

Track an `i32` depth counter starting at 1 (the outer `Tag::Item` is consumed by the caller before this helper runs). Increment on nested `Tag::Item`, decrement on `TagEnd::Item`, return when depth ≤ 0. Captures the full outer item including any nested lists. Removes the lines 64-67 half-mitigation. Returns an empty / partial Vec only if the underlying iterator drains before balance — defensive, can't crash.

**File:** `crates/egui_commonmark/egui_commonmark_backend/src/pulldown.rs:52-74`

### Fix C — Align math options between parses

`show_scrollable()`'s parse now mirrors `show()`'s `math_enabled` derivation: `options.math_fn.is_some() || cfg!(feature = "math")`. Both code paths produce the same event stream, so split-point indices and viewport-iteration indices refer to the same events.

**File:** `crates/egui_commonmark/egui_commonmark/src/parsers/pulldown.rs:559-585`

### Fix A — Gate split-point creation on container state

After `process_event(...)` runs, only add a split-point if we're at a block-end AND outside any stateful container (`!is_inside_a_list() && !is_table && !is_blockquote`). Defense-in-depth — even if Fix B regresses or a similar leak appears elsewhere, the viewport-skip path won't land iteration in a half-built renderer state.

**File:** `crates/egui_commonmark/egui_commonmark/src/parsers/pulldown.rs:485-540`

### Fix P1a — Slice-clone instead of full-Vec clone per frame

The viewport-clipped branch was cloning the *entire* parsed-events Vec (`scroll_cache.events.clone()`) on every frame, then `skip`ing all but the ~100 visible events. On Recent-Changes.md (29,676 events) that was ~1.5 ms/frame of pure allocation churn — about 9 % of the 16.6 ms frame budget at 60 fps. The accumulated cost is exactly the "scroll became laggy" symptom reported by the user.

The fix uses the binary-search range we already computed from `split_points` to clone only the slice that iteration will actually consume:

```rust
let range_end = last_event_index.min(scroll_cache.events.len());
let events_range: Vec<(Event<'static>, Range<usize>)> =
    if first_event_index < range_end {
        scroll_cache.events[first_event_index..range_end].to_vec()
    } else {
        Vec::new()
    };
```

NLL handles the borrow: the slice clone releases the `scroll_cache` borrow before `process_event` re-borrows the cache mutably inside the loop. The iterator's `map(|(offset, ev)| (offset + first_event_index, ev))` re-attaches the original event indices so the `if i == 0` bootstrap-newline gate keeps working.

The full `Arc<Vec<…>>` refactor (originally proposed P1a) would have required changing `process_event` to take `&Event` throughout — a much bigger change for the same win.

## Measurement (Xvfb, release build, 1100×600 window)

| File | Metric | Pre-fix | Post-fix | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Recent-Changes.md (437 KB, 7481 lines, 4567 list items, 272 nested) | Panic on scroll | **SIGABRT** | **clean** | — |
| Recent-Changes.md | `split_points` count | 2570 | 2429 | −141 (−5.5 %) |
| Recent-Changes.md | First bootstrap_paint | 536 ms | 518 ms | −18 ms (−3.4 %) |
| Recent-Changes.md | **Per-frame slice/clone cost** (median over 500 scroll-frames) | **1565 µs** (Vec::clone of 29,676 events) | **8 µs** (slice-clone of ~83 visible events) | **−196×** |
| Cassette-Replay-System.md (355 lines, 51 list items, 10 nested) | Panic on scroll | unreliable repro | clean | — |
| Cassette-Replay-System.md | `split_points` count | 82 | 82 | 0 |
| Cassette-Replay-System.md | First bootstrap_paint | 92 ms | 92 ms | 0 ms |

**Crash:** the panic going away is the primary correctness win; the split-point reduction is a side benefit of Fix A removing the in-list points that were never safe to use anyway. Cassette-Replay-System.md has no in-list split-points before or after (its nested lists are short YAML-frontmatter-style snippets), so Fix A is a no-op there.

**Scroll perf:** Fix P1a is the dominant scroll-perf win. 1565 µs/frame is ~9.4 % of the 60 fps frame budget — exactly the "scroll feels sluggish" complaint. 8 µs is ~0.05 %, essentially free.

The crash repro on Recent-Changes.md is reliable: launch → focus the window → resize (forces a fresh bootstrap with a different layout signature) → ~500 wheel-down events. Pre-fix: panic within ~10 seconds of scrolling. Post-fix: scroll cycles 500 down + 500 up + resize cycle + 300 more scrolls without panic, and `coredumpctl list mkdv` shows no new entries.

## Testing

- `delayed_events_list_item_simple_item` — unit test (egui_commonmark_backend): simple list, helper stops at the matching `TagEnd::Item`.
- `delayed_events_list_item_nested_sublist` — unit test: outer item containing nested sub-list, helper captures the inner `TagEnd::List` and stops only at the outer `TagEnd::Item`. (FAILED on unfixed code.)
- `delayed_events_list_item_drained_iterator` — unit test: defensive — iterator drains before close, helper returns partial collection without panic.
- `nested_list_renders_via_show` — integration test (egui_commonmark/tests/wrapping.rs): smoke test for the `show()` path.
- `nested_list_does_not_panic_in_show_scrollable` — integration test: three-pass repro (warm cache, jump via `pending_scroll_offset`, settle). **Confirmed to FAIL on unfixed code** with `panicked at placer.rs:112: Negative child size` (a layout-state panic that bubbles up from the same root cause).
- `deeply_nested_list_renders` — integration test: 3-level nested list through both `show()` and `show_scrollable()`.

## Verification campaign (post-implementation, 2026-05-17)

After the user pushed back on "did you test thoroughly?" — none of the implementation
tests had reproduced the crash on the actual file from the T470 coredump,
compared rendered output, swept different doc shapes, or exercised long-running
stability + multi-tab. This section captures the follow-up campaign.

| Phase | Scope | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | Reproduce on Cassette-Replay-System.md (the T470 file) | **PASS via case (b)** | Pre-fix scroll/resize did not crash on this doc; split-point dump shows all 82 entries land at safe positions (`End(Paragraph/Heading/CodeBlock/List)`). No `Tag::Item` / mid-list landings exist for this doc. The T470 crash on Cassette was likely from clicking another doc (e.g. `Recent-Changes.md` — present in the explorer tree at the time) which DID expose the bug. Post-fix on Cassette: clean. |
| **B** | Visual regression at multiple scroll offsets | **Partial PASS** | Captured pre/post screenshots at offset 0 (top): files are 246 542 bytes each, visually identical (`prefix_top.png` vs `postfix_top.png` in `/tmp/phaseB/`). Mid/deep offset captures failed repeatedly due to bash-sandbox lifecycle issues; mitigated by the logical equivalence of the slice-clone change (same `first_event_index`/`last_event_index` math, narrower clone window — no semantic change to iteration). |
| **C** | Document sweep: 5 doc shapes | **PASS (5/5)** | prose-only (README.md), table-heavy (HIERARCHICAL_RAG_PIPELINE_EXPLAINED.md, 100 table rows), code-heavy (200 sections × 3 code blocks each, 11 600 lines), math-heavy (30 theorems with `$..$` + display math + `$0.02` currency), deeply-nested (5-level list). All survived 100-down + 100-up + resize + 50-more scrolls. Zero panics. |
| **D** | Slice-clone edge cases | **PASS (5/5)** | D1 tiny viewport (100 px tall), D2 scroll-to-bottom + overscroll (3 000 + 200 events), D3 tall window at top (`i == 0` newline gate), D4 rapid back-and-forth (5× 100-down + 100-up), D5 narrow window forcing frequent re-bootstraps (400 px wide). Zero panics. |
| **E** | 5-min stability | **PASS** | RSS oscillated 272 → 340 MB (bounded, no leak), final RSS 264 MB (lower than start — mimalloc returns to OS). 0 panics. App alive throughout. CPU steady ~120 % during active scroll (multi-threaded), elevated as expected. |
| **F** | egui MCP / AccessKit interaction | **N/A (build config)** | The `mcp` feature is commented out in `Cargo.toml` (per the publish-time MCP-strip pattern in `LESSONS.md`). Re-enabling would require an out-of-scope build change. Rationale for skipping: the fixes touch only the markdown renderer internals (`delayed_events_list_item`, split-point gate, slice-clone); none modify which UI widgets exist or how they register with AccessKit. Risk of regression here is low. |
| **G** | Multi-tab session restore | **PASS** | Patched persisted state to `open_tabs=[readme.md, Cassette-Replay-System.md], active_tab=Some(1)` (matching the T470 coredump). Relaunch: tabs restored, alive, no panic. Scroll active tab: no panic. 5× Ctrl+Tab + scroll cycles: no panic. |

**Summary:** 6 phases PASS, 1 partial (B — offset-0 verified, mid/deep skipped due to sandbox issues), 1 N/A (F — build config). No new bugs found.

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Apply same depth-tracking to `delayed_events` (generic) — same structural bug used by `blockquote()` and `def_list_def_wrapping()`. Causes rendering glitches (not panics) for nested blockquotes / nested def-list-definitions.
- [ ] Long-list virtualization: allow split-points at `TagEnd::List` (outermost only) with paired `Tag::List` replay so 10k-item lists don't fall back to bootstrap full-paint for every viewport. Today they degrade gracefully (slow but correct) under Fix A.
- [ ] Unify the two parses into one source. Today `show()` parses into `cache.cached_events` and `show_scrollable()` parses into `sc.events`; with Fix C they're identical but still duplicated. An `Arc<Vec<…>>` shared field would save ~tens of MB on large docs.
- [x] ~~P1a~~ — fixed via slice-clone (see Fix P1a above). Simpler and equivalent perf to the proposed `Arc<Vec<…>>` refactor.
- [ ] P2a: self-disarming `active_search_y` on converge, so manual scroll after a search jump doesn't bounce back.
- [ ] P1b: width bucketing for layout-signature. Bootstrap re-runs are now cheaper (slice-clone is fast), so this is lower priority — defer until resize lag is reported again.
- [ ] P2b: unify `cache.cached_events` and `scroll_cache.events` (currently two parsed copies of the same content).
